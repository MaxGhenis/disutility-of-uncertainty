# Simulated Referee Reports for Journal of Public Economics

## Editor's Summary

Dear Author,

We have now received three referee reports on your manuscript "The Welfare Cost of Tax Rate Uncertainty: Evidence from Information Provision." The referees find merit in your research question and appreciate the tractable framework you develop. However, they raise several concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be considered for publication. Please find the detailed reports below and provide a point-by-point response with your revision.

## Referee Report 1

### Summary

This paper examines the welfare costs of tax rate uncertainty using a model of optimal labor supply calibrated with U.S. data. The main contribution is quantifying these costs at 0.4-1.2% of GDP and showing that middle-income households bear the largest burden. The paper is well-written and addresses an important policy question.

### Major Comments

1. **Cobb-Douglas Assumption**: The use of Cobb-Douglas preferences is restrictive. While the authors argue this isolates the pure uncertainty effect from risk aversion, it also eliminates important channels through which uncertainty may affect welfare. The paper should include robustness checks with CES preferences and different elasticities of substitution.

2. **Dynamic Considerations**: The static model abstracts from savings and investment decisions, which are likely important channels through which tax uncertainty affects welfare. At minimum, the authors should discuss how incorporating dynamics would affect their estimates.

3. **Empirical Identification**: The paper conflates policy uncertainty with complexity-induced uncertainty. These have different policy implications - the former requires advance notice of changes while the latter requires simplification. The empirical section should better distinguish between these sources.

### Minor Comments

- Table 1 should include summary statistics for the full PolicyEngine sample
- The literature review could better connect to the recent work on attention and salience in taxation
- Some notation is inconsistent between sections (Ï„ vs t for tax rate)

### Recommendation

Revise and resubmit with major revisions addressing the preference specification and identification concerns.

## Referee Report 2

### Summary

The authors develop a tractable framework for analyzing tax uncertainty and provide empirical estimates using PolicyEngine-US data. The finding that information provision is Pareto-improving is interesting and policy-relevant. However, I have concerns about the welfare calculations and distributional analysis.

### Major Comments

1. **Welfare Metrics**: Converting utility losses to dollar equivalents using marginal utility of consumption is problematic when comparing across heterogeneous agents. The paper should use equivalent variation or compensating variation for welfare comparisons.

2. **Distributional Analysis**: The claim that middle-income households face the highest uncertainty costs needs more careful analysis. Is this driven by the tax schedule complexity, labor supply elasticity differences, or measurement error in tax perceptions? The mechanism needs to be identified.

3. **PolicyEngine Limitations**: The paper relies heavily on PolicyEngine-US but doesn't discuss its limitations. How representative is the synthetic population? How accurate are the MTR calculations for complex tax situations?

### Minor Comments

- Figure 3 is hard to read - consider using different colors or patterns
- The introduction oversells the contribution - $180 billion seems implausibly large
- Missing discussion of general equilibrium effects

### Recommendation

Major revision needed. The welfare analysis needs to be more carefully done, and the distributional claims require better support.

## Referee Report 3

### Summary

This is a competent paper that makes a useful contribution to understanding the costs of tax complexity and uncertainty. The integration of theoretical modeling with empirical calibration using PolicyEngine is novel. The paper is generally well-executed but could be strengthened in several dimensions.

### Major Comments

1. **External Validity**: The analysis focuses on the U.S. tax system. How would results differ in countries with simpler tax codes? Some international comparison would strengthen the external validity.

2. **Behavioral Considerations**: The paper assumes rational expectations about tax distributions. Behavioral evidence suggests systematic biases in tax perceptions. How would incorporating these biases affect the welfare calculations?

3. **Policy Experiments**: The paper could be strengthened by analyzing specific policy proposals. For example, what would be the welfare gain from eliminating the AMT or simplifying the EITC schedule?

### Minor Comments

- The Jupyter Book format is innovative but makes it harder to read as a traditional paper
- Some sections are too long (literature review could be condensed)
- Need more discussion of how results relate to optimal tax theory

### Recommendation

Minor revision. The paper makes a solid contribution but would benefit from addressing behavioral considerations and adding policy experiments.

## Response Strategy

To address the referees' concerns:

1. **Add CES robustness checks** - Show results hold for elasticities 0.5-2.0
2. **Clarify identification** - Better separate policy vs complexity uncertainty
3. **Improve welfare metrics** - Use equivalent variation for cross-household comparisons
4. **Add behavioral extension** - Section on biased tax perceptions
5. **Include policy experiments** - Analyze specific simplification proposals
6. **Strengthen empirical validation** - Compare PolicyEngine to IRS SOI data

These revisions would address all major concerns while maintaining the paper's core contribution.
