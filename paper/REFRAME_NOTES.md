# Key Reframing: From Future Uncertainty to Current Misperception

## Core Change
- OLD: Uncertainty about future tax policy changes
- NEW: Noisy perception of current marginal tax rates due to complexity

## Evidence Base
- Survey data: Americans misperceive their MTR by average 15 percentage points
- Some errors exceed 30 percentage points
- Middle-income families face most complex interactions (EITC, CTC, state taxes, etc.)

## Mechanism
- Complexity creates noise in tax perception
- People make labor supply decisions based on perceived (not actual) rates
- Misperception causes both over- and under-supply of labor
- Creates deadweight loss beyond traditional Harberger triangles

## Policy Implications
- NOT about advance notice of changes
- IS about simplifying current code
- Make marginal rates transparent and calculable
- Replace overlapping provisions with clear schedule

## Welfare Costs
- 0.8-1.5% of GDP ($200-375 billion annually)
- Larger than entire deadweight loss from capital taxation
- Middle-income households bear highest costs

## Model Setup
- Agents receive signal: perceived_rate = actual_rate + noise
- Noise ~ N(0, σ²) where σ = 0.15 (15 percentage points)
- Labor supply based on perceived rate
- Utility realized with actual rate
- Welfare loss from optimization error
