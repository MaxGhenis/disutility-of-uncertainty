# The Welfare Cost of Tax Rate Uncertainty: Evidence from Information Provision

**Max Ghenis**

## Abstract

Tax rate uncertainty imposes significant welfare costs on economic agents who must make labor supply decisions before knowing the exact tax rate they will face. This paper quantifies these welfare losses using a model of optimal labor supply under uncertainty, calibrated with real marginal tax rates and income distributions from the United States. I find that eliminating tax rate uncertainty could generate welfare gains equivalent to 0.4-1.2% of GDP, with larger effects for middle-income households who face the greatest variation in effective marginal rates. The analysis demonstrates that providing clear, advance information about tax policy changes represents a costless way to improve social welfare. Using data from PolicyEngine-US, I show that a social planner aware of these information effects would choose different optimal tax rates than one ignoring uncertainty, suggesting that current tax policy analysis may systematically misstate optimal rates by failing to account for uncertainty costs.
