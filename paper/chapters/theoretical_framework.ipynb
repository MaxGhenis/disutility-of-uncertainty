    "## Decomposing the Welfare Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "The total welfare effect of tax uncertainty can be decomposed into several components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct effect**: Agents make suboptimal labor supply choices\n",
    "2. **Fiscal effect**: Tax revenue differs from expected, affecting transfers\n",
    "3. **Distribution effect**: Uncertainty affects different income groups differently\n",
    "4. **Dynamic effect**: Uncertainty may change savings and investment (not modeled here)\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative importance of these effects depends on the wage distribution, tax progressivity, and the nature of uncertainty."

    "## Key Theoretical Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical analysis yields several important results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uncertainty creates deadweight loss**: Even with Cobb-Douglas preferences where income and substitution effects offset for wage uncertainty, tax rate uncertainty generates welfare losses because agents cannot optimize ex-post.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Losses increase with uncertainty**: The welfare loss is approximately quadratic in the standard deviation of tax rates, meaning that small reductions in uncertainty can have meaningful welfare effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heterogeneous effects**: Middle-income households typically face the largest welfare losses because they:\n",
    "   - Have sufficient labor supply flexibility to be affected\n",
    "   - Face more complex tax schedules with various phase-ins/outs\n",
    "   - Cannot easily afford professional tax planning\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimal tax adjustment**: A social planner accounting for uncertainty should set lower tax rates than suggested by standard models, as uncertainty amplifies the efficiency cost of taxation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Information value**: Providing clear, advance information about tax changes is equivalent to a lump-sum transfer to all agents, representing a Pareto improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "These theoretical insights provide the foundation for the empirical analysis that follows, where we calibrate the model using actual U.S. tax data."
