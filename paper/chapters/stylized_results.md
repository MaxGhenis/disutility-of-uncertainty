title: Stylized Results on Tax Uncertainty
description: Bias, uncertainty, planner responses, and optimal taxes
---

This chapter summarizes stylized results produced by the analysis scripts in this repository (blocks 1â€“4). Figures are generated by `make figures` (or `make myst`) and written to `paper/figures/`.

Block 1: Bias and utility loss
------------------------------

```{figure} ../figures/block1_bias_loss.png
---
name: fig-b1-bias
---
Block 1: Utility loss vs. perceived tax bias. The worker chooses labor based on a biased tax perception; utility is realized at the true rate.
```

Block 2: Uncertainty and utility loss
-------------------------------------

```{figure} ../figures/block2_uncertainty_loss.png
---
name: fig-b2-uncertainty
---
Block 2: Utility loss vs. symmetric tax uncertainty. Shows both the expected-tax optimization rule and the expected-utility maximizing labor rule.
```

Block 3: Two workers and planner with ex-post demogrant
-------------------------------------------------------

```{figure} ../figures/block3_two_worker_welfare.png
---
name: fig-b3-two-worker
---
Block 3: Average welfare vs. tax (two workers). Planner sets the tax and demogrant under perfect information, then demogrants are adjusted ex-post under uncertainty.
```

Block 4: Optimal taxes and social welfare under uncertainty
-----------------------------------------------------------

```{figure} ../figures/block4_opt_tax_vs_sd.png
---
name: fig-b4-opt-tax
---
Block 4: Optimal tax vs. tax-rate uncertainty. The planner internalizes uncertainty; optimal taxes decline as uncertainty rises.
```

```{figure} ../figures/block4_welfare_vs_sd.png
---
name: fig-b4-welfare
---
Block 4: Average welfare vs. tax-rate uncertainty. Expected welfare falls relative to perfect information due to concavity.
```

Notes
-----

- Preferences and environments are configurable in `scripts/run_analysis.py` and controlled by command-line options in `make figures`.
- The uncertainty specification uses a symmetric five-point distribution around the mean tax rate; results include both expected-tax optimization and EU-maximizing behavior.
